# Web Server

## What is a web server?

It is a server running on the physical/vm server that receives the request from the client using the HTTP protocol and returns the HTTP response.

The client can be a website or any other program that is using HTTP to communicate over the network.

We make use of `sockets`. Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.
